# Founder decisions after the V1 spec

These override `docs/V1-SPEC.md` where they differ. Date: 2026-09-29.

## D1. Models run on contributors' own subscription CLIs. wOS holds no model API keys.
- Fable and Opus run through the contributor's installed `claude` CLI (Claude Code), signed in with their Claude subscription. Model ids: Fable `claude-fable-5-1`, Opus `claude-opus-5-5`.
- Astra is ChatGPT's model, run through the contributor's installed `codex` CLI (OpenAI Codex CLI), signed in with ChatGPT. Model id on the founder's machine: `gpt-6-astra` (in `~/.codex/config.toml`, where `model_reasoning_effort` is the reasoning setting).
- wOS launches these CLIs as local processes. It never reads, stores or proxies the contributor's model credentials.
- Consequence: the server cannot prove which model ran. Agent Policy must treat model identity as an attestation, and cross-review (D2) is what keeps it honest.

## D2. Reviews run on a DIFFERENT contributor's machine.
- A builder never reviews their own work. Astra review and Fable review are each a leased review task, assigned by the control plane to eligible contributors other than the author (and ideally two different reviewers).
- Deterministic verification (typecheck, lint, tests, scope/diff check) is re-run in GitHub Actions on the PR. A contributor's local "tests passed" is never trusted alone.
- Bootstrap problem: at launch the founder is contributor zero and there is nobody else to review. The architect must specify a bootstrap mode (who may review when the pool is too small, how that is labelled publicly, and when it switches off).

## D3. Tokens and points are one unit.
- WOS tokens are in-app credits, earned per individual for accepted work. The running total is the person's score; the leaderboard ranks it.
- One append-only ledger, one unit. Balances are derived, never stored-and-mutated.
- Not cryptocurrency, not transferable, no cash value. Required public wording wherever tokens appear: "WOS tokens are in-app credits with no cash value."
- The ledger must support debits (spending may be added later) without a schema change.

## D4. GitHub
- Org: currently `deployreadystudio` (display name already "warOnSaaS"); the founder is renaming the login to `waronsaas`. Use `waronsaas` in all contracts and URLs.
- Main repo: `waronsaas/waronsaas`, PUBLIC. All warOnSaaS repos are public (open source). The three old Deploy Ready repos in the org are private and out of scope.
- Decide explicitly whether architecture blockers / `wos resolve` / roadmap proposals use GitHub Issues, PRs, or both.

## D5. Hosting and data
- Vercel team `battle-juice` (Pro). Domain `waronsaas.com` is on Vercel DNS (the founder's registrar is Namecheap; nameservers now point to Vercel).
- Mail for the domain is forwarded by ImprovMX (MX + SPF records in Vercel DNS) — do not touch those records. App-sent mail (notifications, sign-in links) should use a sending service on a subdomain such as `notify.waronsaas.com`.
- Postgres on Supabase, created in AWS us-west-2 (Oregon). Vercel functions pinned to `pdx1` (same region). Not created yet — the founder creates it when the architect says what is needed.
- Secrets live in Vercel env vars (GitHub App private key, webhook secret, DB URL, OAuth secret). The desktop app and CLI hold only the contributor's own short-lived wOS session (OS keychain via Electron safeStorage / keytar-equivalent for the CLI).

## D6. Public website already in progress
- A separate agent is building `apps/web` now (static Next.js, honest 0% everywhere, data in `apps/web/data/targets.ts`, deployed as Vercel project `waronsaas-web`). The architect must NOT edit `apps/web`; it adopts it into the monorepo and specifies how it will switch from the static data file to the control-plane API.
- The founder asked that download instructions be written as if the Desktop build exists: releases at `https://github.com/waronsaas/waronsaas/releases/latest`, CLI package `@waronsaas/cli`, binary `wos`.

## D7. Lessons carried over from the founder's previous product (Deploy Ready)
- Put the app and database in the same region first; cross-region cost ~95% of latency there.
- Row-level security from day one if multi-tenant data exists; the app connects as a non-bypassing role.
- A migration runner with a ledger, applied by a ship gate — nothing migrates production by hand silently.
- A ship script that refuses a dirty tree, an unpushed commit, or red CI before deploying.
- Vercel CLI deploys are BLOCKED if the HEAD commit author is not a project member; commits must be authored `adventurini <anthonydventurini@gmail.com>`.
- Tests must not pin absolute dates that pass "now"; build fixture times relative to the clock.
- Static assets served immutable must have hashed filenames.
- Electron signing/notarization must run in CI (GitHub Actions); `notarytool` uploads from the founder's Mac crashed repeatedly.
